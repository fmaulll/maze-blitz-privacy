<strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong><br>
<p>These terms and conditions apply to the Maze Blitz game (hereby referred to as "Game") for mobile devices that was created by Daze Studio (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service.</p><br>

<p>By downloading or playing the Game, you are agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to playing. Unauthorized copying or modification of the Game, any part of the Game, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Game, translate it into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Game remain the property of the Service Provider.</p><br>

<p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Game is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Game or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Game or its services will be clearly communicated to you.</p><br>

<p>The Game may store and process personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Game. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions imposed by the official operating system. Such actions could expose your device to malware, compromise its security features, and may cause the Game to not function correctly.</p>

<div>
  <p>Please note that the Game utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Game:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity</a></li>
  </ul>
</div><br>

<p>Some functions of the Game require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Game does not function properly due to lack of internet access or data allowance.</p><br>

<p>If you are playing the Game outside of a Wi-Fi area, your mobile network provider's terms will still apply. This may result in charges, including roaming data charges. By playing the Game, you accept responsibility for any such charges. If you are not the bill payer for the device used to access the Game, it is assumed you have obtained permission from the bill payer.</p><br>

<p>The Service Provider also cannot be held responsible if your device runs out of battery or for any impact on performance resulting from low power. It is your responsibility to keep your device charged and maintained for uninterrupted gameplay.</p><br>

<p>The Service Provider strives to ensure the Game is updated and accurate at all times, but they rely on third-party sources. Therefore, they accept no liability for any loss—direct or indirect—that you experience as a result of relying entirely on the functionality of the Game.</p><br>

<p>The Game may be updated from time to time. The Game is currently available for Android, but requirements may change. You may need to download updates to continue playing. The Service Provider does not guarantee the Game will always be updated to match your operating system. They may also stop providing the Game at any time without notice. Upon termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you will end, and (b) you must stop using and delete the Game from your device.</p><br>

<strong>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</strong>
<p>The Service Provider may update these Terms and Conditions periodically. You are advised to review this page regularly. Changes will be posted on this page.</p><br>

<p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-04-30</p><br>

<strong>Contact Us</strong>
<p>If you have any questions or suggestions about the Terms and Conditions, please contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:dazesh1treal@gmail.com">dazesh1treal@gmail.com</a>.</p>
